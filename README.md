## Reflections
This was the most challenging assignment so far in this class for me. I was never able to actually work on the tasks because I couldn't get the server set up correctly. Even just trying to create an account with the provided code didn't work. The sever was able to find and connect to the mongo database on compass but I couldn't get the provided routes to do what they were supposed to do and had no way to test it. I was, however,  able to set up a remote database and deploy to Heroku despite the features not working. UPDATE: I was able to work back around and fix the problems I originally had and the assignment went pretty smoothly after that.
